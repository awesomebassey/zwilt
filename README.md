This is a submission of the Reactjs Evaluation by Punch.

The submission uses Next.js and Chakra UI to create the design as shown in the provided Figma design.

Next.js was used because of it's superior features - this ensures that the project is scalable and can include custom routing, caching and various API calls with ease.

Chakra UI was also used because of it's readymade reusable components that can easily be customized to suit any changes to the UI or functionalities in the nearest future.

## Challenges

Some parts of the UI were very challenging to represent as they contain some unrealistic design patterns but I did my best to represent them as best as I could.

Also, some parts of the design were not done to scale so they look a lot bigger on bigger screens. This was also caused by lack of access to accurate measurements; Figma needed to be enabled in Dev Mode for some precise measurements to be gotten and this was practically impossible at the time.

The project was created to be as near picture-perfect as possible and with assumptions that in the real world, changes to certain styles employed would be made and effected - this means that the site is not perfect, but it was created with the assumption that in the real world, there would be room for corrections and updates.
